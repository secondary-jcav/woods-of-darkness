    “Ahh, here we are.” You step out of the car and take a deep breath. 
    The pines hit your nostrils like over‑enthusiastic air‑freshener, and somewhere a crow coughs apologetically.
    Livia, still buckled in the passenger seat, watches with the weary stoicism of someone who lost a bet they don’t remember making.
    Looming above is the weather‑beaten sign **Woods of Darkness**; a smaller hand‑painted notice underneath promises *Now with 30 % more darkness – Money‑back guarantee!* 
    You clap your hands. Adventure, or at least an anecdote for next Thanksgiving, awaits.

    “I still don’t get why it’s called the ‘Woods of Darkness.’” Livia climbs out of the passenger seat,
    immediately shading her eyes as though the trees might dim the sun on cue.
    She circles to the trunk and begins unloading camping supplies with the air of someone performing community service.
    “Honestly, it’s just an ordinary patch of woods—minus the hysterical marketing.”

    “An ordinary patch of woods *home to the most fearsome monster the world has ever seen!*” you announce, grin stretching wider than health guidelines recommend.
    “My grandpa told me all about it! It has horns, and a thick fleece so matted with branches, leaves, and the *bones of its victims* that it probably gets HBO for free.”
    Livia snorts. “Your grandpa also claims pigeons are government drones. Color me skeptical.”
    “In any case,” she sighs, heaving a backpack onto her shoulders, “we’re here. You dragged me out. Whoopee. Now, where are we camping?"

campsite:
  text: |
    “Oh, we’re camping in the *designated* campsite,” you declare, finger raised like a tour guide nobody hired.
    “After all, that’s clearly where a monster is most likely to attack—paperwork’s easier.”
    Livia rolls her eyes but follows you. Soon, your tents are pitched in a clearing marked with a cute sign reading *‘Official Area of Spooky Shenanigans’*.

    “We’re going straight to the heart of the woods!” you proclaim.
    “That’s where we’ll spot the monster casually jogging its evening 5K.”
    Livia raises a brow. “And if we get a fine for camping off‑grid?”
    “Adds authenticity!” You march into the gloom, Livia muttering about bail money behind you.

    It takes half an hour to locate a clearing where trees politely scoot aside for your tents.
    Night drips from the canopy; you gnaw cold marshmallows—crunchy, like disappointment—because fire would spoil the ambience *and* attract real campers.
    Suddenly a scream slices the air. You leap up, wearing a grin normally reserved for roller‑coaster photographers.

campfire_story:
  text: |
    You strike a single dramatic match and hold it beneath your chin. Shadows pirouette across the pines like tipsy ballerinas.
    “Gather round, Livia,” you whisper. “Behold the tragic saga of *The Woolen Wraith Who Couldn’t Get a Date*.”
    She groans but sits anyway—because the alternative is assembling the camp stove.

ghost_prank:
  text: |
    You bellow, fling the match, and shower Livia with cold marshmallows like paranormal confetti.
    Her scream curdles milk in a three‑mile radius; her retaliatory boot introduces itself to your ribs.
    As you wheeze, she announces the ghost story over and heads to bed victorious.

    Livia follows, her breathing ragged. In the dark you trip over roots, logs, and what you *hope* was a very relaxed squirrel.

    “Inside the tent!” you bark, bravery dissolving like sugar in tea.
    You dive into nylon safety; Livia joins, zippering you both inside what is essentially a stubborn plastic bag.
    You try not to think about the fact the monster could probably slice it open with a stern glance.

    “Quick!” You snatch the marshmallow bag, skewer a sacrificial few, and arrange them like bait on a mousetrap buffet.
    Livia sensibly barricades herself in her tent. Outside, the chorus of screams grows louder—accompanied now by what might be banjo music.

    You sweep your flashlight forward. Hanging upside‑down from a snare is a creature with the lower body of a sheep and the upper body of a man—nature’s patch note nobody asked for.

    Opportunity knocks—well, *dangles*. You whip out your phone, set flash to *nuclear*, and grin beside the captive cryptid.
    “Cheese!” you say; “Bleat!” it replies. The resulting photo is equal parts nightmare fuel and oddly wholesome.

    “Oh, thank you!” the monster gasps as your pocketknife slices the rope. “Now run, before they catch you too!”
    It bounds three heroic steps—straight into another snare. *Twang!* Up it goes, bonking the same tree, inventing new swear words in Sheep‑ish.

    “Honestly, you seem *built* for dangling,” you shrug. “Consider it interval training.”
    From deeper in the forest, heavy footsteps echo. The monster howls in panic.
    Three men emerge, wielding comically huge shears and canvas bags labelled *Property of Monster Management Agency*.
    One squints at you. “Evening, campers. Problem?”

    More footsteps thunder closer. You glance at Livia, then slice the rope once more and drag the woolly fellow into a bush.

    “We’re… uh… what are *you* doing here?” you counter, excellent deflection.
    “Monster Management Agency,” says the leanest one, flashing a badge shaped like a terrified goat.

    “Monster Management Agency, you say?” Your eyes shine like someone
    just mentioned free merch.  
    The lead agent sighs and produces a clipboard roughly the size of
    a door. “Form 482‑B: *Volunteer Cryptid Wrangler.* Sign nowhere,
    initial everywhere.”  
    Bureaucracy, you realise, is simply horror wearing bifocals.

    Three hours, two existential crises and one mandated coffee break
    later, you’re still stuck on question 1:  
    **“Do you currently possess horns? (Y/N)”**  
    While you debate pen colours, the agents shear the monster again,
    finish the tidy‑up and clock off.

    Overnight your monster selfie detonates on social‑media.  
    By breakfast you’re fielding sponsorship offers from antihistamine
    brands and knit‑wear startups (“Wraith‑Wool™— frightfully cosy!”).  
    The monster—now an influencer—streams reaction videos to lawn‑mowers.
    Fame smells faintly of barnyard, but you’re rich enough to buy

    Livia exhales. “Home grim home.”
