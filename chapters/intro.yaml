    “Ahh, here we are.” You step out of the car and take a deep breath.
    The smells of the pines filled the air as wind swept down off the mountains. “The Woods of Darkness.”

    “I still don’t get why it’s called the ‘Woods of Darkness.’” Livia climbs out of the passenger’s seat,
    then walks around to the trunk, where she begins to unload the camping supplies.
    “There’s nothing that dark about it. It’s just an ordinary patch of woods.”

    “An ordinary patch of woods home to the most fearsome monster the world has ever seen!” You say, grinning.
    “My grandpa told me all about it! It has horns, and thick wool filled with tree branches, leaves, and the bones of its victims!”
    “You grandpa tells you all sorts of things.” Livia sighs and slings a backpack over her shoulders.
    “In any case, we’re here. You drug me out. Whoopee. Now, where are we camping?"

    “Oh, we’re camping in the campsite.”
    You start walking out of the parking lot toward the marked location for tents and campfires.
    “After all, that’s where a monster is most likely to attack!”
    Livia rolls her eyes, but follows you. Soon, you have your tents pitched in the small clearing.

    “We’re going straight to the center of the woods!” You declare loudly.
    “That’s the place we’re most likely to see the monster just wandering through the woods!”
    “And if we get in trouble for camping in a non-designated area?”
    “Just part of the experience!” You strike off into the woods, with Livia following closely behind.

    It takes the two of you the better part of half an hour to find a suitable clearing, where the trees parted just enough for them to pitch your two tents.
    As the night begins to fall about you, you sit down and begin to eat their marshmallows cold, as you don't want to risk a fire.
    Suddenly, though, a scream echoes through the air, coming from only a short distance away from the tents!
    You leapt to your feet, a smile spreading across your face.

    “Come on!” You race off into the woods, leaving the comfort of the tents behind.
    Livia follows closely, her breathing ragged as she races through the woods.
    In the darkness, you trip over fallen logs, sprawled across gnarled tree roots, and fall headlong into puddles of mud.

    “Inside the tent!” You order, your bravery evaporating quicker than a drop of water on hot cement.
    You dive back inside your own tent, and are somehow unsurprised when Livia joins you.
    You zip the tent shut, and try not to think about the fact that you are only separated from the monster
    by a piece of fabric that could be knocked over by a strong wind.

    “Quick!” You grab the bag of marshmallows, stick several of them on sticks, and unzip the tent. “Help me!”
    Livia, for her part, simply dives into her own tent and waits. You quickly set out a number of the tasty treats, then go into Livia’s tent and zip it up.
    You clutch each other as the screams grow louder, and a number of voices begin to echo through the woods.

    You grab a flashlight off your belt, point it forward, and flick the switch on.
    To your immense surprise, you find a rather hairy creature with the lower body of a sheep and the upper body of a man.
    To your even greater surprise, the creature is dangling upside-down from a snare, and kicking and screaming wildly.
    “Get me down!” It calls out loudly. “I don’t want to be eaten!”

    “Oh, thank you!” The monster gasps as you pull out a pocketknife and cut him down. “Thank you thank you thank you! Now run, before they catch you, too!” 
    The monster turns and bounds into the woods, making it three steps before he steps into a second snare.
    There is a sharp twang, and with a rush of wind and leaves, the sheep-man is slung up into the air once more.
    His head smacked against the trunk of the tree, and he slumps, unconscious.

    “No, I think I’ll leave you up there.” You shake your head. “I don’t know why you’re up there, but I’m sure you deserve it.”
    Suddenly, from deeper in the woods, footsteps begin to echo.
    The monster howls louder, and a moment later, three men wielding enormous shears and canvas bags come tromping out of the trees.
    They looked at the two teenagers, and one of them coughs. “Just what are you kids doing here?”

    More footsteps began to echo from deeper in the woods, and you glance at Livia.
    You quickly cut the sheep-man down once again, then drag him into a patch of nearby brush.
    With that, you turn and run, fleeing desperately back down toward your car.
    After all… If a monster was scared of something, what would the two of you be able to do against it?

    “We’re… Ahh… What are you doing here?” You counter.
    “We’re with the Monster Management Agency.” The leaner shrugs. “It’s our job to catch and shear this guy ever year, and dehorn him if necessary."
    "Keeps him from getting all wooly and scary, which, of course, cuts down on the number of reported monster sightings,
     the number of people who get lost in the woods trying to run away from him, and so on."
    "We’ll only be a few moments, you two can run along.”

    You and Livia watch, unable to believe what you are seeing, as the three men set upon the monster, and soon enough have him sheared.
    They then cut him down, and he dashes away in shame.
    With that, the three agents leave, and you and Livia were left standing in the woods.
    It is a story that you will never be able to get out of your head… Even if you don't even believe it yourself at this time.
