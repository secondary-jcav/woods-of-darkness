    “Ahh, here we are.” You step out of the car and take a deep breath.
    The smells of the pines filled the air as wind swept down off the mountains. “The Woods of Darkness.”

    “I still don’t get why it’s called the ‘Woods of Darkness.’” Livia climbs out of the passenger’s seat,
    then walks around to the trunk, where she begins to unload the camping supplies.
    “There’s nothing that dark about it. It’s just an ordinary patch of woods.”

    “An ordinary patch of woods home to the most fearsome monster the world has ever seen!” You say, grinning.
    “My grandpa told me all about it! It has horns, and thick wool filled with tree branches, leaves, and the bones of its victims!”
    “You grandpa tells you all sorts of things.” Livia sighs and slings a backpack over her shoulders.
    “In any case, we’re here. You drug me out. Whoopee. Now, where are we camping?"

    “Oh, we’re camping in the campsite.”
    You start walking out of the parking lot toward the marked location for tents and campfires.
    “After all, that’s where a monster is most likely to attack!”
    Livia rolls her eyes, but follows you. Soon, you have your tents pitched in the small clearing.

    “We’re going straight to the center of the woods!” You declare loudly.
    “That’s the place we’re most likely to see the monster just wandering through the woods!”
    “And if we get in trouble for camping in a non-designated area?”
    “Just part of the experience!” You strike off into the woods, with Livia following closely behind.
